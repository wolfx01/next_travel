# Project Status Report
**Date:** December 20, 2025
**Project:** Next.js Travel Application ("Explo")

## 1. Executive Summary
The application has undergone significant improvements in stability, user interface design, and mobile responsiveness. Critical backend bugs preventing user registration and content loading have been resolved. New professional UI components (Hero sections, Sidebar) and functional integrations (Aviasales Widget) have been successfully deployed.

## 2. Key Achievements

### ✅ Critical Bug Fixes (Stability)
*   **Database Connection**: Resolved the persistent `ECONNREFUSED` error. Authentication (Register/Login) is now fully functional.
*   **Place Details Crashing (500 Error)**: Fixed a server crash caused by the application incorrectly processing full country names.
*   **Broken Place Links (404 Error)**: Fixed a data mismatch where the "List" page and "Details" page were looking at different datasets. Clicking a place now correctly loads its details.

### 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements
*   **Professional Mobile Navigation**:
    *   Replaced the basic menu with a modern **Right-Side Sidebar**.
    *   Added **Glassmorphism** effects (blur/transparency).
    *   Included **User Profile & Logout** controls directly in the menu.
    *   Added **Icons** for visual appeal on mobile.
*   **Hero Sections**:
    *   Implemented premium, full-width **Hero Headers** on the *Countries* and *Places* pages.
    *   Features high-quality background images with dark overlays for perfect text readability.
*   **Homepage Tweaks**:
    *   Refined the main Hero text alignment and styling.

### 🚀 New Features
*   **Aviasales Flight Search Widget**:
    *   Replaced the static "Search Flights" button on the Place Details page.
    *   Implemented a **Custom React Widget** that mimics the official design (to bypass external script blocking).
    *   Allows users to select Origin, Destination, and Dates to perform real flight searches.

## 6. Next Recommended Steps
